# DAHA

The code for data and hardware cost model, group-based in-turn pipelined sampling and inter-batch scheduling for GNN training. Make a directory under root named ./data with three sub-directories ./data/OGB, ./data/DGL, and ./data/PYG. And the public datasets will be automatically downloaded to the corresponding directories.
